                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Putting myself into words is practically a hellish task for me to conquer. I mean hell I put off doing this till last minute. But...I've come across a term for myself. A funny one. A Swiss Army Knife of Creativity. Doing a ton of creative work in different disciplines from Instrumentation, Mixing, 3D Art, Photography, Cooking, Abstract Art, Programming, Game Development, Generative Art. You can see why I'm a lil bit of an enigma of sorts.
                    <br><br>
                    I've been paleo and keto for 8 years now - which means I dont eat sugar, bread, milk, sweets, etc. All of what I own fits into a car. My purpose of life is improving/inspiring myself and others through the magic of creativity.
                    <br><br>
                    My work is especially focused in the domain of Sound. Mastering, Mixing, Composition, Sound Design, Guitar playing, Bass, Piano, Sampling, Generative Music, Ambient, Any genre you name. I love the world of audio and sound and dedicate my life to it.
                    <br><br>
