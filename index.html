                <h2>SNES Drum Transcription? (Gemfire)</h2>
                <p>
                    With an interest in making drum midi that sounds realistic and nice to use for projects, of course my first thought like any normal person was to look under obscure retro games that I've never heard of! In this case I went with a game I've never heard of, but has high reviews, called Gemfire. 
                    <br><br>
                    First on the chopping block is to yknow. Um. Play the game I'm going to be transcribing. So...Here goes nothing! My first playthrough impressions of Gemfire.

                    Inspired by the works of Death Grips and Noisy Lofi Rock Bands, I created a lil kit just for the occasion~

                <p>
                    I was given the task of composing an ethereal chamber folk song for a game jam game! My good friend kathinka hired me to do a loop for it and I couldn't have been more happy to do music for her. Apparently I knocked it out of the park, I'm proud of it, and it helped me gain so much confidence in my work hearing how it was perfect for the project...Simply beautiful. Absolutely am going to do more work like this!
